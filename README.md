Hi, this is my public repository where you can find my applications that I wrote C#. These are most of the programs I wrote because I needed to improve my work or just learned programming. If you like the code or have any questions or suggestions then let me know at [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukaszfd84/) .
